This project is to recreate the Google homepage with an HTML file.
I have utilized HTML and CSS to recreate a visual likeness of the standard Google homepage. I focused on learning to use flex containers and struggled with getting exact placement correctly, especially within the search bar. 
This project was an exercise from The Odin Project's Web Development course: (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
